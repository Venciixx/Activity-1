<h2>Lyzel Venice P. Falmarin IS 3B</h2>
<p>My name is Lyzel Venice P. Falmarin. I was born in Taytay, Rizal but I'm currently living in Caibiran,Biliran. My birthdate is March 08,2003 and 20 years old. My Father's name is Vladimir Ma. Mocorro Falmarin, he is a nurse in United Kingdom. While my Mother's name is Ruby Diego Pagaduan, she takes care of my sibblings. I did not grow up under the care of my parents. I felt intense envy of children who were able to be with their parents during those times. It is too difficult having these kind of experience, but that doesn't stop me from studying and striving hard so that someday I can be successful already. I can admit that me myself was raised well with good manners by my grandmother. And I'm happy by just being me and doesn't need to change for the sake of others. I am also a part of LGBTQ+ and I'm proud of it.</p>
